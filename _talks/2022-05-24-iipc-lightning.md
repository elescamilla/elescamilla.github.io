I presented a pre-recorded lightning talk at IIPC WAC 2022 detailing the initial findings of my research. In addition to the lightning talk, some of my colleagues and I created a [blog post](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2022/06/iipc-wac-2022.html) summarizing the conference. Below are the slides I presented.

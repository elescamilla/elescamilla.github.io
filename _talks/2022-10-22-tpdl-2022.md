Our publication, [The Rise of GitHub in Scholarly Publications](/publication/2023-07-26-rise-of-github), was accepted at TPDL 2022 and, as a result, I gave a presentation of our work in Padua, Italy. In addition to the presentation, a colleague and I wrote a [blog post](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2022/10/2022-10-11-tpdl2022-trip-report.html) summarizing the conference. Below are the slides I presented.

I am currently a PhD student at Old Dominion University in the Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) Research Group. I started the program in Fall of 2021. Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my BS in Computer Science at Liberty University in May 2021. I specialized in Web and Mobile Development and Software Engineering. 

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) on the CoSAI (Collaborative Software Archiving for Institutions) team which is [funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/9628). As a part of this team, we are developing a decentralized, federated framework for institutional archiving of research software and other open scholarly materials.

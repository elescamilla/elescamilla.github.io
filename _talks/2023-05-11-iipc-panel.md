I presented a summary of our work with the CoSAI project on a panel discussing institutional initiatives to implement Web archiving. In addition to the panel, I created a [blog post](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2023/05/iipc-wac-2023.html) summarizing the conference. Below is the full slide deck including the slides I presented.
